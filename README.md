# Ancheera

A Granblue Fantasy companion Chrome extension.

## Installation
Download a zip copy of the extension to your computer. Unzip it wherever you like.

In your Chrome extensions page, click "Load unpacked extension..." and point to the folder. To recompile after changes, hit the reload button beneath the extension. The styles are written with sass, so you'll need a sass compiler like compass which should watch the src folder for changes.

## Usage
To use AnCheera, Open the Developer Tools and select the "Makira" tab. I renamed it Makira for no particular reason but if this is an issue please message me.

### Open DevTools
Use one of the following options to open the DevTools

1. Press F12
2. Right-click a page element and select *Inspect*.
3. Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (Windows, Linux).

Then select the `Makira` Panel.
